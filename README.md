# breachpoint-backend

Bun + Elysia backend, structured as a clean-architecture layered app backed by Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL.

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env
bun install
docker compose up -d postgres
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

### Layer rules

- **routes → controllers → services → repositories → models → db.** Each layer only calls the one directly below it.
- **`services` never touch Drizzle/the DB directly** — only `repositories` may import `db/client.ts`. `models` are pure table/view definitions with no query code. This keeps business logic testable and swappable independent of persistence.
- **`controllers` hold no business logic** — they validate input (via `schema/dto` request schemas), delegate to `services`, and shape the HTTP response.
- New resources get a same-named subfolder in `routes`, `controllers`, `services`, and a file in `models`, `repositories`, and `schema/dto`.

## Data model

Tables live in `src/models/`, split into `core/` (reusable CTF engine) and
`event-specific/` (`sz_*`, the Signal Zero module — safe to drop wholesale
after the event; `sz_*` references `core_*`, never the reverse). Shared
categorical vocabularies are Postgres enums declared once in
`src/models/custom-types.ts` and re-exported as TS unions, so the database and
the service layer cannot drift.

### Scoring identity

Every competing unit is a **team** — solo players get a team of one
(`core_team.is_solo`). `core_team` is both the competing unit and its
registration in an event — the key everything scores against; `core_team_member`
is the single source of truth for membership. (There used to be a separate
`core_participant` paired 1:1 with each team; it was collapsed into `core_team`
to drop a join from every scoreboard read.) Every "which teammate did this"
column (`core_solve.solved_by`, `core_submission.submitted_by`, ...)
foreign-keys into `core_team_member (event_id, user_id)`, so an actor is
always a registered, team-affiliated user in that event.

### There is no `is_deleted`

Deletion is modelled per-table with the state the domain actually needs:

| Intent | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Pull a broken challenge mid-event | `core_challenge.state = 'hidden'` |
| Remove a player from play | `core_user.is_banned` |
| Keep admin/test entries off the board | `core_team.is_hidden` |
| Disqualify a team, keep the evidence | `core_team.disqualified_at` + reason |
| Reverse a solve (bad flag, cheating) | `core_solve.revoked_at` + reason |
| Erase an account | anonymise `core_user` in place — see the comment on `core_user` |
| Retire an event | `DELETE` the `core_event` row; children cascade |

A blanket soft-delete flag was removed because it silently broke every unique
constraint in the schema: a "deleted" user still owned their username, and a
"deleted" team still owned its name and could never re-register.
`core_submission` is append-only — never updated, never deleted — so it
carries neither `updated_at` nor any deletion state.

### Querying the views

`core_leaderboard` and `core_challenge_solve_count` carry `event_id` through
every aggregate and `GROUP BY` it, so **always query them with a
`WHERE event_id = $1` predicate** — that is what lets Postgres push the filter
into the aggregation instead of summing every solve in the database. A frozen
leaderboard is a separate, time-bounded query against `core_solve`, not a mode
of this view.


## Round 1 — Signal Zero

The module lives in `src/services/signal-zero/` and is inert unless the event
has `sz_path` rows: an event with no paths is a plain CTF and every visible
challenge is open, which is what keeps the reveal rules out of core.

| Rule | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Reveal window — 2 revealed, then always 3 exposed | `reveal.service.ts` (`syncUnlocks`) |
| Path selection and switching (8 solves = free switch) | `path.service.ts` |
| Skips (quota 4 per team per event, drops the path to 0.80) | `skip.service.ts` |
| Time Glitch windows and the scoring override | `time-glitch.service.ts` |
| Fragments and the convergence gate | `submission.service.ts` + `sz_challenge_prereq` |
| The event page in one call | `board.service.ts` |
| Narration, flags and points, transcribed from the docs | `content.ts` |

`syncUnlocks` is written as a *target* state rather than an incremental
"unlock one more": recomputing it can only add rows a correct history would
already have produced, so it is safe to call after any change and is what
repairs a team whose window was left short. It runs on team creation, path
selection, every solve, every skip, and on every board read.

### Seeding

```bash
bun run db:seed        # 32 challenges, 3 paths, 30 story rows, 5 prereq rows
```

Idempotent by content — re-running updates challenges and narration in place
and never touches team state, so a typo fix mid-event is a re-run. Challenges
seed `hidden`; opening them is the deliberate second step:

```bash
bun run db:publish                 # opens now, runs 8 hours
bun run db:publish -- --hours 48
bun run db:publish -- --close      # unpublish and re-hide
```

`db:publish` only moves challenges `hidden -> visible`; one an admin has pulled
back to `locked` is left alone, so re-publishing never undoes that.

### The first admin

`/auth/signup` always creates a non-admin — an event where anyone can register
themselves as an admin has no admin routes worth guarding. So the first admin
comes from someone with database access:

```bash
bun run db:admin -- --email ops@axios.net --username ops --password '...'
bun run db:admin -- --email existing@user    # promote someone already registered
```

Without one, the Time Glitch and challenge-management routes are unreachable.

**Before the event runs**, confirm the two placeholder flags in `content.ts`
(`SEED_WELCOME` and `SEED_CONVERGENCE`) with the content team — the narration
document does not specify either. C8 ships as one combined flag per decision C6.

### Player routes

```
GET  /events/:eventId/board              the event page, in one call (see below)
GET  /events/:eventId/paths              paths + intro narration + what's available
POST /events/:eventId/paths/select       pick a path (requires the welcome solve)
POST /events/:eventId/paths/switch       free at 8+ solves, else 0.80 on the new path
POST /events/:eventId/skips              spend a skip
GET  /events/:eventId/time-glitch        is decay suspended right now
```

`/board` is what the client renders a whole session from, and it is deliberately
wide so a player page is one request rather than six:

| Field | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `team`, `score`, `rank`, `solveCount` | the HUD — `score` comes straight off `core_leaderboard`, hint spend already netted out, so the HUD and the scoreboard can never disagree |
| `pathScores` | points per path code, plus `standalone` for the pathless ones |
| `paths` | all three: progress, points, whether active / attempted / available |
| `path` | the active attempt, with its reward multiplier |
| `challenges` | the active path's reveal window, with `preStory`; `postStory` is withheld until solved |
| `history` | what the team closed on *every* path, by sequence — so a chart still shows work done on a path the team has left |
| `standalone` | the welcome gate and, once three fragments are held, the convergence final; `isFinal` tells them apart |
| `skips`, `fragments`, `timeGlitch` | quota, what's been earned, whether decay is suspended |

Each challenge carries both `initialPoints` (the headline) and `currentPoints`
(what a solve pays right now, decay applied). Both come from
`services/challenges/scoring.ts`, which `submission.service` also prices solves
with — a board that quoted one number while the submission paid another would
look like the server cheating.

Client-side derivation of any of this is a bug: points decay, reveals and the
welcome gate are all server rules, and a client that recomputes them will drift.

Admin: `GET|POST /admin/events/:eventId/time-glitches`,
`POST .../generate` (hourly schedule), `DELETE .../:glitchId`.

## Scripts

- `bun run dev` — start the dev server with hot reload
- `bun run db:generate` — generate a Drizzle migration from `src/models`
- `bun run db:migrate` — apply pending migrations before starting the API
- `bun run db:seed` — load Signal Zero content and create three admins; set `ADMIN_1_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_2_PASSWORD`, and `ADMIN_3_PASSWORD` to unique passwords of at least 32 characters first
- `bun run db:publish` — open the event for play (or `-- --close` to shut it)
- `bun run db:admin` — create or promote an individual admin
- `bun run db:seed:admins` — seed 3 administrative logins into the database
- `bun run db:studio` — open Drizzle Studio

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres   # Postgres only, for local dev
docker compose up --build       # full stack (app + Postgres)
```

In compose, a one-shot `migrate` service applies migrations, then `db:seed` imports challenges and seeds admin accounts before starting the API server. Control seeding with
`AUTO_SEED`, `AUTO_PUBLISH`, and `EVENT_HOURS` (see `.env.example`); set
`AUTO_SEED=false` and `AUTO_PUBLISH=false` to start the API alone.

With `AUTO_SEED=true` you can configure `ADMIN_1_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_2_PASSWORD` and
`ADMIN_3_PASSWORD`.

The production Portainer stack lives in the frontend repository. It runs
`db:migrate` and `db:seed` as one-shot services before the API, and never
prints passwords.

**A redeploy re-seeds.** `db:seed` imports the challenges, then calls
`seedAdmins()`, then publishes the event unless `AUTO_PUBLISH=false`. Two
consequences that matter once the event is live:

- **The event window moves.** Publishing sets `starts_at` to *now* and
  `ends_at` to now + `EVENT_HOURS` (default 48), so redeploying mid-event
  extends the competition. Set `AUTO_PUBLISH=false` in the stack environment
  to redeploy without touching the window.
- **Admin passwords are reset** to `ADMIN_1/2/3_PASSWORD` for accounts that
  already exist — a password changed in-app does not survive a redeploy.

Team progress is unaffected either way: seeding is idempotent by content and
never writes to solve, submission, or team state.

### The event window

`ensureCanScore` refuses every point-changing action outside `starts_at`/
`ends_at`, and `/board` with it. Team formation and the scoreboard stay open on
both sides of the window, which is what lets the client show a lobby before the
gun and final standings after the close instead of an error.

## The frontend

[`breachpoint-frontend`](../breachpoint-frontend) is the player client. It holds
no game rules: flags, point values, reveals, skip legality and path entry are
all decided here and rendered there. `FRONTEND_URL` accepts a comma-separated
list of origins so a dev server, a preview build and a deployment can share one
backend.
